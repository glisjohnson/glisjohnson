# Title - The HEX.COM Fiasco

## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?
HEX is a cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum Blockchain. It is not a company nor a project, but a product. 
* When was the company incorporated?
HEX was launched on December 17, 2019.
* Who are the founders of the company?
The founder is Richard Heart.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea for HEX came from a stem of problems and hardships the founder, Richard Heart ecncountered over his long stead with Bitcoin. He thinks Bitcoin's
main problem is its security model. Bitcoin's code is very Italian, or in his words, "spaghetti code" and does not do much because it cannot do much. 
When people try to upgrade a part of the Bitcoin network, they usually in return mess up another part of it. He saw what worked and did not through the
crypto space since 2011 and created his version of the ideal cryptocurrency.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
HEX is not funded as it is just code on Ethereum. For the first 353 days from launching, users could send in Ethereum and recieve back HEX (same mechanism
as EOS launch). 2.37 million Ethereum went through this adoption amplifier. Ethereum was actually recycled back into the amplifier by the amplifier 
address so it is very difficult to determine how much was actually funded. 
The Origin Address wallet of HEX recieves 50% of all penalties accrued in HEX's staking feature.
